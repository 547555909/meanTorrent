1. It is forbidden to publish torrent resources in forums or other places where individual opinions can be expressed.
1. After the torrent is uploaded, it will not be immediately displayed in the list unless it is reviewed by the administrator or the administrator has given you upload permission to upload directly.
1. Any torrents you uploaded, administrators can set more additional attributes, such as recommended levels, sales levels, resource tags, and so on.
1. When uploading torrents, you should select the attribute tags accurately and as comprehensively as possible, because users will index small areas according to different tags at any time. If tags and resources do not actually match, they will be deleted and punished by the administrator.

&emsp;

#### :white_small_square: Seeding

1. The system has a share rate requirement for all download behaviors. The current requirement is `%(announceConfig.downloadCheck.ratio).2f`, so after you publish, extend the time for planting as much as possible to earn as much upload and scores as possible.
1. The system does not check the sharing rate for users who have newly registered `%(announceConfig.downloadCheck.checkAfterSignupDays)d` days. Therefore, new users should increase their sharing rate as much as possible during this time.
1. Don't stop seeding without anyone finished download. If you have special circumstances, please leave a message under the relevant torrent detail page.

&emsp;

#### :white_small_square: Upload and download data size

* Seed uploaders calculate the upload volume of `* %(salesGlobalConfig.uploader.value.Ur).2f`.
* Other users calculate the normal upload amount.
