 * CronJob
 *
 * constructor(cronTime, onTick, onComplete, start, timezone, context, runOnInit) - Of note, the first parameter here can be a JSON object that has
 * the below names and associated types (see examples above).
 *    cronTime - [REQUIRED] - The time to fire off your job. This can be in the form of cron syntax or a JS Date object.
 *    onTick - [REQUIRED] - The function to fire at the specified time.
 *    onComplete - [OPTIONAL] - A function that will fire when the job is complete, when it is stopped.
 *    start - [OPTIONAL] - Specifies whether to start the job just before exiting the constructor. By default this is set to false. If left at
 *            default you will need to call job.start() in order to start the job (assuming job is the variable you set the cronjob to). This does
 *            not immediately fire your onTick function, it just gives you more control over the behavior of your jobs.
 *    timeZone - [OPTIONAL] - Specify the timezone for the execution. This will modify the actual time relative to your timezone. If the timezone is
 *                invalid, an error is thrown.
 *    context - [OPTIONAL] - The context within which to execute the onTick method. This defaults to the cronjob itself allowing you to call this.stop().
 *              However, if you change this you'll have access to the functions and values within your context object.
 *    runOnInit - [OPTIONAL] - This will immediately fire your onTick function as soon as the requisit initialization has happened. This option is
 *                set to false by default for backwards compatibility.
 * start - Runs your job.
 * stop - Stops your job.
